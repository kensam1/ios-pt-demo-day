## Questions (Answer indented below)

1. What was your favorite feature to implement? Why? 
I enjoy this entire project completely. From creating the main screen to creating the currency converter. But my favorite was building and implementing the metric converter. The reason this was my favorite is because I dedicated the most of my time to this feature, and it used alot of calculation and math which is my favorite subject.

2. What was your #1 obstacle or bug that you fixed? How did you fix it?
My #1 obstacle was figuring out the code on how to convert backwards. I tried to make my app dynamic that the user can put in a measurement for the basic unit (meters, grams, liters) to a metric unit (deka, hecto, kilo, deci, centi, mili) and vice versa. The first part was simple, but figuring out how to convert backwards was tricky. I figured something out but I still had minor bugs with the calculations. So i decided to make that part of the code a stretch goal because I didnt want to focus on this part of the app for a long time.
  
3. Share a chunk of code (or file) you're proud of and explain why.

## Presentation Format

**7 minutes/team**

* 4 minute presentation (5 minute hard cap)
* 3 minutes of questions

We have ~12 teams presenting today — please practice your presentation with a timer (as a team), and make sure you fit within the time limit.

Plan on having one person present the slides and live demo. Please practice your presentation in front of a mirror or with your team 2-5 times. Have the app running and visible (Simulator or QuickTime) so you can quickly transition between slides and live demo.

* App Name / Team Slide (30 seconds)
* Elevator Pitch Slide (30 seconds)
* Your #1 Feature (30 seconds)
* Live Demo (2 minutes)
* Future Goals (30 seconds)
* Questions (3 minutes)
